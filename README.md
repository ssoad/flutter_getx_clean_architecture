A clean architecture template for Flutter projects using the GetX state management library.

## About the Project

This project serves as a template for building Flutter applications with a focus on clean architecture principles and utilizing the GetX package for state management. The goal is to provide a structured and maintainable foundation for Flutter developers to kickstart their projects.

### Key Features

- **Clean Architecture:** Separation of concerns with clear divisions between data, domain, and presentation layers.
- **GetX State Management:** Leverage the power of GetX for simple and efficient state management.
- **Project Structure:** Organized directory structure following clean architecture practices.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ssoad/flutter_getx_clean_architecture.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```

## Project Structure

The project structure follows the principles of clean architecture to ensure maintainability and scalability. Here's an overview:

- **core:** Contains the base configurations.
- **domain:** Contains the business logic and domain entities.
- **data:** Manages data-related operations, including repositories and datasources.
- **presentation:** Handles the UI logic with GetX controllers, bindings, and pages.
